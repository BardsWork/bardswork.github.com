  <h1>{{ site.name }}</h1>

  <p>I am currently an IT professional who attens school with a concentration in Software Engineering, which I hope, one day, make me a lot of money so I can build an army of super smart robots who will help me overthrow society. I'm imagining a world that resembles Terminator meets Matrix, but with a happy ending, and lots of puppies.</p>
  <p>As my dreams of world domination are not very achievable, I have a backup plan of hosting a website, that bears my name, with the intention to entertain all the visitors with a touch of, hopeful, insight. Those said visitors will then shower me with gratitude for my amazin wit, and delightful insight.</p>
  <p>If you are interested, you can click the many links to get in <a href="mailto:email@alexbard.me">contact</a> - <a href="www.twitter.com/bardworx"> with</a> - <a href="www.github.com/bardworx">me</a>, or you can find my address on the internet, somehow, and send me a gift - if you so choose.</p>
  <p>Thanks.</p>
  <small>P.S. This site is built with Jekyll, hosted on Github, and was forked from Zach Holman's Left theme. No links are provided as I'm way too lazy to format it properly</small>
