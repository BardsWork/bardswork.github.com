title: Are Tablets the way of the Future?	
category: posts
---

## Recently my mother, who is a computer programer and computer illiterate, told me; Desktops are dieing, tablets are the way of the future.

I was shocked, you can imagine. First, I didn't know she actually cared - I thought she only came to work, loaded up her environment, hack away at the mainframe, then go home to feed the dog and garden. After getting over my initial shock, I whole heartedly agreed with her, saying that YES, I thought that desktop computers are dieing as well...but then I thought some more.

## Two good reasons

There are two great reasons why everything, and thier mother, thinks that computers are going away;
1. Moore's Law dictates that the computing power will grow to a point where an iPad can handle everyting we do now on a PC. ## TRUE
2. Mobile is the way of the future, tablets are more mobile, hence tablets are the future. ## TRUE

So if the above two points are true, then the assumption that desktop computers are dieing is also true...## not true?


Thank for reading.
