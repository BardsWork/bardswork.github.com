title: Experience with a Hackintosh
category: posts
---

A week or so ago my computer at work decided that it didn't like to be updated to the latest release of Ubuntu, and when kindly asked if it would run Windows, it happily declined.

After some consideration, and running out of options, I decided to try my hand at a Hackintosh. The thought has been on my mind for a while and I've had some material already saved in Evernote  so the jump was fairly easy with majority of the research already done. Thankfully, the computer that I currently use is an old Dell Vostro 220 that happen to be a perfect fit for an alternative installation of OSX - everything running out of the box besides audio, which I don't use.

With another of quick research, and the frustration of using a laptop for a full work day I fully committed to the project, which surprisingly was fairly seamless. Using myHack and Multibeast, the computer was up and running in less then two hours time, from start to finish (if you don't count the time it took to format the SD card). The one conclusion that I can draw from just the install is how simple it was in comparison to Linux or Windows, there were fewer updates that I had to go through and majority of the functionality worked out of the box - not surprising for OSX.

After setting up the computer just the way right - while catching up with emails, I was fairly happy. For an old PC it ran OSX surprisingly well, almost too well in my opinion. For a 2.8 Core2Duo with 4 Gigs of Ram and a regular HDD, I was impressed, but not for long. As soon as I had to parse a very large DB to finalize a report, I started seeing hiccups - some programs were not as responsive and some utterly crashed and burned. However, for the re-purposed PC, this wasn't a bad deal.

If you're interested in participating, here are a few links that you might find useful, or at least helped me through this process;

[Tonymacx86 Forums](http://www.tonymacx86.com/371-building-customac-buyer-s-guide-july-2013.html "TonyMacX86") with a list of verified compatible hardware.

[MultiBeast 5.4](http://www.tonymacx86.com/373-multibeast-5-4-update.html "MultiBeast 5.4") a post-installation utility to help with drivers/kext and other useful features.

[myHack Website](http://myhack.sojugarden.com/ "myHack") an easy utility to properly format your USB or SDCard for installation of the hackintosh.

After a few weeks with my new re-incarnated PC I have definitely come to the realization that I need better hardware to have a smoother experience. Otherwise I'm able to re-download my apps that were purchased at home, get all features, besides iMessage (which I don't use), to work and haven't had a single complaint. For my next build, a $500 investment will get me pretty much decent computer that can handle anything that I can throw at it. Who said Mac's have to be expensive?


Thanks for reading.
