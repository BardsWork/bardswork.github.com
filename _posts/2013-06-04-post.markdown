title: How to Switch Careers for Beginners (from X to Technology)
category: posts

Nine months ago I made an exciting change of industries from Hospitality, where I worked for a decade, to IT. The switch had a 
lot of challenges; coming out of my comfort zone while learning on the fly and  concessions had to be made; I had to take a 
pay cut and work two jobs. However, it was do-able, more so, it was totally worth it to grow as person while doing something
that I love.

Since then, I keep meeting people who also want to change industries - some to follow their passion while others are looking
for a better opportunity for advancement - and all the people I meet have the same question: How did you do it?

First, finances are important. If you are leaving a position to go into a different industry, prepare to take a paycut.
No one wants to hire an entry-level employee with no experience and pay them a boatload of money. They do, however, want
fresh meat who will work their respective butt's off trying to prove they belong, which makes a lot of sense.

Consider this - a startup is usually strapped for cash, they want to expand and make money. Here comes a new employee
that has some form of experience or knowledge that can possibly grow into a position - they (the start up) know you will 
be excited to join a culture of caring people and at the same time do what you love. Since it will take some time
to train you in their corporate culture, as well as for your position, they offer you an entry salary of 35-40K per year.
You, coming from a job where you made more, are insulted. There are bills to pay, mouths to feed, and drinking to be done.

The situation above might not be valid for you, however I feel this is the number one reason people don't switch careers. 
You, on the other hand, might be different. Perhaps you are one of the few individuals who are willing to sacrifice it all -
sleep on friend's couches, live off five bucks a day, or max out your credit cards just to reach your goal. If you are, then
you don't need my advice. But if you aren't, I think you should consider a different option: two jobs.

It is easy to take a pay cut and work part time in a career of choice when you have something else to fall back on. Perhaps
picking up waiting shifts or working part time in a local coffee shop or bookstore or even walk your neighbor's dogs. Anything
that would supplement your income while you are fighting for raises and going from part-time to full time.

I, worked part-time while getting a job waiting tables part time as well - this allowed me the finances to keep a roof
over my head while at the same time inching towards my goal. I believe this was a crucial part of my success because it
alleviated the stress that would normally come with worrying about money. Don't get me wrong, money was tight, but I was
working towards a goal - which was huge.

In addition to finding a way to manage your finances while you are in the middle of your switch, I also think it is important
to focus on your future - seeing the end result. Envisioning a future where you do what what you love helps you wake up at
five in the morning and coming home at 9 PM, sometimes seven days a week. At the same time, I believe it is also very
important to set a date for your accomplishments. If you were hired for an internship, focus on the three to six
month window - if the employer does not offer you a full time position, perhaps its time to move on. The beginning of your
career it is more important to add to your resume, just as much as doing what you love.

Lastly, immerse yourself into the field of choice. If you can, go to meetups, join clubs, and find anyone and everyone who does
what you want to do. Besides having an opportunity to meet someone who might offer you a position, you will also gain access
to people could help you answer questions or provide guidance.

Besides joining clubs and expanding your network, scour the interwebs for all possible job opportunities. Craigslist, Monster,
your school's Internship office, anyplace that can possibly lead you to your new job. Once you're there, create a spreadsheet 
on Google Docs, Excel, or Numbers and keep track of every job you applied to, date, and when/if they replied. Having
statistics on your progress will help you send more resumes. Have a goal to apply to 20 positions days, or three times a week,
or whatever floats your boat - but apply!

Perhaps all these things are self evident, perhaps not - either way, break down your task, and start doing. As long as your
finances are good and you have the will, the rest will fall into place with a lot of hard work and determination.

Thanks for reading.
