title: Are Tablets the way of the Future?	
category: posts

 Recently my mother, who is a computer programer and computer illiterate, told me; Desktops are dieing, tablets are the way of the future.

I was shocked, you can imagine. First, I didn't know she actually cared - I thought she only came to work, loaded up her environment, hack away at the mainframe, then go home to feed the dog and garden. After getting over my initial shock, I whole heartedly agreed with her, saying that YES, I thought that desktop computers are dieing as well...but then I thought some more.

### Two good reasons

There are two great reasons why everything, and their mother, thinks that computers are going away;
1. Moore's Law dictates that the computing power will grow to a point where an iPad can handle everything we do now on a PC.
2. Mobile is the way of the future, tablets are more mobile, hence tablets are the future.

So if the above two points are true, then the assumption that desktop computers are dieing is also true...## not true? Even though tablets will be very powerful in the near future and we will have enough processing power, and memory, to handle all of our basic tasks, desktops will still not go away. How would the drones of the 9-5 struggle cope with a mouse/keyboard/monitor free world? How would data entry be done? On a tablet? I doubt it.


Thank for reading.
