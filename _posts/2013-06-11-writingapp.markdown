title: Writing(Hand Recognition) Apps for iOS
category: posts
---

I want to start a petition of a decent god-damn writing app for an iOS, or ANY operating system, that frankly doesn't suck! Why am I able to connect to my computer from a** thousand miles** away to fix a problem, then speak with my family - in a different country, mind you - via **video**, post some food porn to Instagram with a push of an imaginary button, but still have to write things down in a pad?

Don't get me wrong, I love writing, but pen and paper? Still....really?

The last statement sounded like I was some privileged, generation X/Y/Don't know what I am, asshole but hear me out.

First, I don't think that using pen and paper is passe, I love writing down notes while in a meeting or doing re-search, but I am also fabulously famous for misplacing my notes. I usually write in this recycled paper type "moleskin" notebook that I "borrow" from the Creative Department and still I manage to forget them everywhere. 

Yes, there are alternatives, pens that will sync with your computer of choice, typing everything via keyboard, or recording thoughts/meetings with some kind of app or device. I know I can purchase Livescribe pen for $168 to sync my notes with Evernote but the pen is large, ugly, and just another thing to lose.

I'm sure there are reasons for why we cannot use a stylus and a tablet to simulate a pen like experience, technical deficiencies, sensitivity issues, IP, whatever - BUT I WANT A FUCKING APP THAT WORKS and I promise to pay for it...well!

Please someone, please make me a happier man with a simple writing app - greatly appreciated. 


Thanks for reading.
